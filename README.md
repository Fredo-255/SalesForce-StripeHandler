# SalesForce-StripeHandler



## Installing


**1. Deploy the StripeHandler project to salesforce**

**2. Create a Named Credential**

Navigate to  `https://<your_instance_name>.lightning.force.com/lightning/setup/NamedCredential/home`

Then Click `New Named Credential`
Set:
Label: `Stripe_Secret_API_Key`

Name: `Stripe_Secret_API_Key`

Identity Type: `Named Principle`

Authentication Protocol: `Password Authentication`

UserName: `<Your Secret Key from stripe> e.g sk_testsldigjssdlgijsdgli`

Password: `Single space, this will set the password to emtpy and this is what we want`







you will find an example for your **.env** file. Make a copy of `.env.example` at the same level and rename it to `.env`.

For example: `https://<your_instance_name>.lightning.force.com/lightning/setup/NamedCredential/home`


```
cp .env.example .env
```

Replace the placehold variables in the .env file wtih your keys: 

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<replace-with-your-webhook-secret>
```

We've also provided a config file, `config.json` which contains some constants used by the video and concert tickets sections of the app.  See the server file for examples of how to load these values. 

**For Vanilla stack client**

`STATIC_DIR` tells the server where to the static files are located and does not need to be modified unless you restructure the directories.

**2. Follow the server instructions on how to run:**

Please follow the instructions in the README you'll find in the code/server folder on how to run your server.

With your server running the page should look like this:

**Note**: if you are working with the react client, after you start you server, please follow  the instructions in the README you'll find in the code/client folder on how to start the react client.

**3. [Optional] Run a webhook locally:**

We recommend using the Stripe CLI to easily spin up a local webhook.

First [install the CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and [link your Stripe account](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#link-account).

```
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

The CLI will print a webhook secret key to the console. Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to this value in your .env file.

You should see events logged in the console where the CLI is running.


## Your Stripe Account

We'll run test mode transaction on your Stripe account to test your solution. If this activity might disrupt your other work you may want to spin up a separate Stripe account just for these challenges.  We recommend you keep the account you use for challenges up to date with the latest API version. 


## Submitting your challenge

When you are done there are 3 steps to submitting your solution:

* Open a pr with the changes you want to merge into master
* let us know youâ€™ve completed the exam by filling in the template provided. You can either do one push or one per challenge completed. We advise you to create a separate branch in which you can work your solution before merging it into master.
* Merge your changes to master.
* To ensure your challenge can be evaluated, we advise you to run the test scripts in `./test`.

**Note**: Please make sure all your features run in the latest version of Google Chrome.
